# Vairo Di Pasquale's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! Here you can find information about me, my projects, and my experience overall.

This website is designed to resemble the desktop of a computer running Windows '95, in your browser. I chose this aesthetic because it allows me to create a unique, retro look for my website that sets it apart from the typical, modern and boring websites that are often seen today. I also enjoy the nostalgia of the '90s era and wanted to incorporate that into my website.

All of the information for the website is contained in a single HTML file for simplicity and ease of maintenance. This approach allows me to easily update and share the website, as all of the necessary information is contained in one place (and because is faster and Im lazy, mostly).

## Files

- `index.html`: the main HTML file for the website
- `style.css`: the stylesheet for the website
- `main.js`: the main JavaScript file for the website
- `sources` folder: contains images and other assets used in the website

## Running the Website

To run the website, simply open `index.html` in your browser. You may need to enable JavaScript in your browser's settings if it is disabled. Or just visit [www.vairodp.com](vairodp.com) if it's still live.

## Dependencies

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): a JavaScript library used for various tasks such as event handling and animations.
